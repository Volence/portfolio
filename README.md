# My Portfolio Site

Created with NextJS, TailwindCSS, and Framer. To start it, make sure you have docker installed and just run the `start.sh` script.

After running the script the dev environment will be available on http://localhost:3000, if you wish to stop it you can run the `stop.sh` which will also remove the container.
